Cornerstone
-----------

A fully-integrated, robust HTML5 Framework built for [CRONOS](http://www.createdbycronos.com/). It's derived from a ton of different foundations, such as HTML5 Boilerplate, HTML5 Reset Wordpress Theme, Underscores, etc. The main purpose of Cornerstone is to be more powerful in terms of automation. Metadata for initiatives such as the Open Graph Protocol for Facebook and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative are generated by variables. It's also a lot more content-packed with over 100 lines of header data relating to compatibility and customization.
Check out [the Cornerstone page](http://www.haydenbleasel.com/cornerstone) for full details.
